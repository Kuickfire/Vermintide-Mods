title = "Less Annoying Friendly Fire";
description = "A lot of friendly fire damage is actually very small and usually negligible (e.g. hagbane poison or burning ticks), but the fact that they make the screen flash red (in exactly the same way as if a rat hit you) can become quite distracting and confusing.

This mod removes the red arrow indicator and instead displays friendly fire as a red background behind the portrait of the player who damaged you, making it obvious that it came from a player and not a sneaky rat behind you.

The transparency and duration of the red background is determined by the amount of damage dealt to you. So tiny hagbane ticks will be short and feint, while a grudge-raker to the back will be bright and highlight that bastard dwarf's portrait for a good second or two.

Damage you do to yourself (AoE, venting...) is also hidden, instead highlighting your healthbar area at the bottom.

Optionally, the indicators when stormvermin or chaos warriors push you (which deals 0 damage) are also hidden, making it clear that you're not being hurt by their push.

Recommended companion mod: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1448714756]No wobble[/url] - so that the camera is not jolted around when you are hit, or hit yourself.
