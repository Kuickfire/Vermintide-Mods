title = "Less Annoying Friendly Fire";
description = "A lot of friendly fire damage is actually very small and usually negligible (e.g. hagbane poison or burning ticks), but the fact that they make the screen flash red (in exactly the same way as if a rat hit you) can become quite distracting and confusing.

[b]This mod hides the red flashing indicator for low FF damage.[/b]

\"Stop shooting me\" dialog is tied to the indicator, so if the damage is too low to trigger the indicator, the dialog won't play either.

For the shooter, your crosshair still turns green for even low FF, as this isn't really distracting.

To do:

* Alternative FF indicator next to portraits.
* Make threshold a percentage of player health, so it does show the indicator when your health is really low.
* Consider damage dealt over a certain time period - e.g. 10 hagbane arrows of 3 damage each will currently all be ignored, but still hurt like a bitch.
* Debug option to show FF damage in chat, to help you tune the threshold to your liking.
* Option to disable FF dialog for bots, because who cares about them anyway :)
