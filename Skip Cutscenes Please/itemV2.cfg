title = "Skip Cutscenes Please";
description = "Press spacebar at the start of the mission to skip the cutscene you've seen a hundred times before. Only works if all players have this mod installed.

Aussiemon's original Skip Cutscenes mod was denied sanctioning because it affects other players who do not have the mod and \"ruins their anticipation at the start of the map to have a bunch of other players running around derping during the cutscene\".

This mod aims to solve that problem by only allowing you to skip the cutscene if all players in your team are using this mod, thus making it sanctionable.

Obviously based off of the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1391114686]original mod[/url] with permission.
