title = "Stop Pushing Me";
description = "This mod simply disables the annoying red arrow indicators when stormvermin or chaos warriors push you (which deals 0 damage*), making it more clear that you're not actually being hurt by their push.

* Some chaos warrior \"pushes\" are actually punches, which do deal damage. These of course still show the indicator.

Packmaster grabs also show the red arrow indicator (even if dodged) - these are caught by the mod and hidden too.

Another mod you may like: Disable friendly fire indicators for very low-damage hits (e.g. hagbane and fire ticks) ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1405221659]link[/url]).
